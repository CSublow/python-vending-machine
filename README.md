# python-vending-machine
This program uses a series of print statements to interact with the user as they select a drink and insert 'coins" via typing in the amount they want to insert.

The program will then calculate the change due for the amount the user has entered and feedback to the user.

Unfortunately the program is unable to render you an actual drink, this functionality is hoped to be achieved in a future release.
